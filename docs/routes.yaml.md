```yaml
root: nep.al
resources:
  - home
  - post
  - nep
tweaks:
  controller:
    home.home:
      path: /happy/ # this path is primary
      allowed_methods: [ GET ]
      unique: true
  path:
    /favicon.ico: # this path is secondary
      controller: error_handler.not_found
```

The above code is a YAML file defining routes for a web application.

At the top level, the file has three sections: root, resources, and tweaks. The root section specifies the default route
for the web application, which is accessed when no other route is specified. The resources section is a list of
directories containing controllers for the web application. The tweaks section contains two sub-sections: controller and
path.

The controller section of the tweaks section is used to define custom settings for controllers. In this example, the
home.home controller has a custom route of /happy/ and is only accessible via the GET HTTP method. This controller is
also marked as "unique", which means it will not be added to the list of routes automatically generated from the
resources section.

The path section of the tweaks section is used to define custom routes that do not have their own dedicated controllers.
In this example, the /favicon.ico route is defined and is handled by the error_handler.not_found controller.

Overall, this YAML file defines the following routes for the web application:

/: handled by the nep.al controller
/happy/: handled by the home.home controller, accessible only via GET
/favicon.ico: handled by the error_handler.not_found controller
/home/*: handled by the controllers in the home directory
/post/*: handled by the controllers in the post directory
/nep/*: handled by the controllers in the nep directory
