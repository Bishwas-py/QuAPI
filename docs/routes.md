The above Python code is a router that handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct controller. The router is
configured by reading in a routes.yaml file, which defines the various routes and their corresponding controllers.

First, the code imports several modules, including yaml for parsing the routes.yaml file. It then sets up some global
variables, including a dictionary called paths that will hold the routes and their corresponding controller names.

Next, the code reads in the routes.yaml file and extracts the root, resources, and tweaks sections. The root section is
used to define the default route (i.e. the route that is accessed when no other route is specified). The resources
section is used to specify a list of directories containing controllers, and the tweaks section is used to define any
custom routes or controller settings.

The code then processes the controller_tweaks section of the tweaks dictionary, which is used to specify custom settings
for controllers. If the value for a given controller is a string, it is added to the paths dictionary as the route for
that controller. If the value is a dictionary, the code extracts the path and allowed_methods values and adds them to
the paths dictionary along with the controller name.

The code then processes the path_tweaks section of the tweaks dictionary, which is used to specify custom routes that do
not have their own dedicated controllers. For each entry in this section, the code adds the route and the corresponding
controller name to the paths dictionary.

Finally, the code processes the resources section of the routes.yaml file. For each directory specified in this section,
the code looks for Python files (excluding any __init__.py files) and adds their paths and controller names to the paths
dictionary.

Once all the routes have been processed and added to the paths dictionary, the code prints out the routes and their
corresponding controller names in a table format.
